(A) imdb.rating is at least 7
(B) genres does not contain "Crime" or "Horror"
(C) rated is either "PG" or "G"

	    }
	}
	
(B) genres does not contain "Crime" or "Horror"

	{
	    "genres": {
	        "$nin": ["Crime", "Horror"]
	    }
	}

(C) rated is either "PG" or "G"

	{
	    "rated": {
	        "$in": ["PG", "G"]
	    }
	}
	
(D) languages contains "English" and "Japanese"

	{
	    "languages": {
	        "$all": ["English", "Japanese"]
	    }
	}
	
Step 3:- Find count of all filtered documents or pretty() print all the filtered documents.
