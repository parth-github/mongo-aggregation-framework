PROBLEM #1:

Using the Aggregation Framework, find a count of the number of movies that have a title composed of one word. 
To clarify, "Cinderella" and "3-25" should count, where as "Cast Away" would not.

Hint: Use '$split' and the '$size' expression in your pipeline stages.

SOLUTION:

Step 1:- Filter documents in 'movies' collection where title field is of string type only.

	{
	    $match: {
	        "title": {
	            "$type": "string"
	        }
	    }
	}
	
Step 2:- Divide the 'title' in documents which has convoluted titles i.e title with multiple words.

	{
	    $split: ["$title", " "]
	}
	
Step 3:- Match documents received after $project stages whose size is 1 after split operation on title field..
		Size of array must be only 1 to select movie title with only one word.
		
	{
	    "title": {
	        $size: 1
	    }
	}
	
Step 4:- Count the number of documents after filtering done by pipeline stages.
