//Basic Aggregation - $match and $project
//Lab - Computing Fields $match, $project, $type, $split, $size


PROBLEM # 1:

Using the Aggregation Framework, find a count of the number of movies that have a title composed of one word.

To clarify, "Cinderella" and "3-25" should count, where as "Cast Away" would not.

Hint: Use '$split' and the '$size' expression in your pipeline stages.

SOLUTION:

Step 1:  - $match stage to ensure we filter all movies where the title is a string.

{
    "$match": {
        "title": {
            "$type": "string"
        }
    }
}

Step 2:  - $project stage to divide / split the 'title' which has spaces. for ex: Cast Away contains two strings with space - Cast Away

{
    "$project": {
        "title": {
            "$split": ["$title", " "]
        },
        "_id": 0
    }
}

Step 3:  - $match stage to filter documents which has only one element(size is 1) in the newly computed 'title' field.

Size of array must be only 1 to select movie title with only one word.

{
    "$match": {
        "title": {
            "$size": 1
        }
    }
}

Step 4:  - Count all documents itcount(), after filtering done by multiple pipeline stages.
