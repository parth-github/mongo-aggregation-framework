PROBLEM #1:

Using the same $match stage from the previous lab [Lab1_FilteringDocument.txt], add a $project stage 
to only display the the title and film rating (title and rated fields).

SOLUTION:

Step 1:- Update previous lab by adding one more stage '$project' to only display the title and film rating (title and rated fields).

	{
        "$project": {
            "_id": 0,
            "title": 1,
            "rated": 1
        }
    }

Step 2:- Load validateLab2.js

	load('<your-directory-path>\\validateLab2.js')
	
Step 3:- Run the validateLab2 validation method.

	validateLab2(<your-aggregation-pipeline>)
